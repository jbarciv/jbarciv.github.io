I am a PhD student at the [Center for Automation and Robotics](https://www.car.upm-csic.es/) (UPM-CSIC), and part of the [Autopia](https://www.car.upm-csic.es/en/conduccion-automatica-de-vehiculos/) research group, advised by [Dr. Jorge Villagrá](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jorge-villagra-serrano/).

My current research centers on autonomous vehicles, with a specific focus on trajectory generation and decision‑making in driving scenarios.
Additionally, I am exploring related topics such as systems simulation, ODD-awareness and reinforcement learning.

<!--Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
