As part of my first-year PhD training, I had the opportunity to attend the [Cooperative and Interactive Vehicles (CIV) Summer School 2025](https://lnkd.in/dG-fbwTi) in Blonay, Switzerland ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­. I am very grateful to [Arnaud de La Fortelle](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EbiLLC0AAAAJ&hl=en) and the organizers for creating such an inspiring environment for discussions, collaboration, and networking with leading researchers and industry experts in AI, data, connected vehicles, and intelligent transportation systems.

Following the inspiring discussions at CIV Summer School, I am advancing research on **ODD-aware decision-making** for autonomous vehicles. This work, developed within the [Shape Future](https://shapefuture.eu/) project, contributes to Europeâ€™s goal of creating safe, resilient, and future-proof electronics for automated mobility.

The presence of leading scientists and experts, including [Manabu Tsukada](https://tlab.hongo.wide.ad.jp/People/manabu-tsukada/), [Christoph Stiller](https://www.mrt.kit.edu/english/mitarbeiter_stiller.php), [Matthieu CarrÃ©](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthieucarreutc/), [Ahmed Hussein](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q8vHonoAAAAJ&hl=en), [Jeroen A.
